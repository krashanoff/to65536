A simple website for converting text to base65536 and back again.

## What is base65536?

> Base65536 is a binary encoding optimised for UTF-32-encoded text and Twitter. This JavaScript module, base65536, is the first implementation of this encoding.

Using Base65536 to encode UTF-8 represents 56% efficiency, according to the creator, [qntm](https://github.com/qntm).

The JavaScript module used for this implementation, along with links to its constituents in Python, Go, Ruby, and the like may be found at its [repository](https://github.com/qntm/base65536).
